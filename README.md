# Palladio-Core-PCM
The Palladio Component Model (PCM) is one of the core assets of the Palladio approach. 
It is designed to enable early performance, reliability, maintainability, and cost predictions for software architectures and is aligned with a component-based software development process. 
The PCM is implemented using the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).

## Documentation
For comprehensive documentation, please visit our [wiki page](https://github.com/PalladioSimulator/.github/wiki).

## Development Information
We generate source code based on the metamodel during the build process and do not add generated artifacts to the repository. To generate the code, you have to either run the Maven build or the generation workflow (`generate.mwe2`).

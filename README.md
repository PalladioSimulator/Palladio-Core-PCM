# Palladio-Core-PCM
The Palladio Component Model (PCM) is one of the core assets of the Palladio approach. 
It is designed to enable early performance, reliability, maintainability, and cost predictions for software architectures and is aligned with a component-based software development process. 
The PCM is implemented using the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).
